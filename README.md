# Porter Client Set example

 This repository is to demonstrate how to use the porter clientset.  The porter clientset does not yet exist but is a work in progress.

The go.work is sourced to the `getporter/operator` branch locally to troy0820/operator.  This branch is `troy0820/clientset-for-porter`
